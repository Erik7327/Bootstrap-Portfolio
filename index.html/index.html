<div class="article">
	<p>Hi! My name is Leon Moraga, I was born in Arizona, but raised in North Carolina. After completing school I was on a quest to find not only myself but a means to a career and stability for myself.</p>
</div>

	<p>I was on the road allot with my friends looking for something worth wile to hold down and use as motivation to start the beggining of an end for me. I didnt find this until relocating back to Arizona in the summer of 2016, (yes I realize that was a bad time to move to like the hottest state in the us.) There I found myself working, and accompanied by my partner whome I am still happily with. we decided to up and move from there to Berkeley CA where I end up here working toward a bigger picture with this class. With a means to an end; I look forward to when I can unleash my creative insights upon the world wide web.</p>
